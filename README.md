# Elliptic Curve Point Finder & Table Generator

This project is a React application for finding points on elliptic curves over finite fields and generating group operation tables. It allows you to select curve parameters, compute the points, and visualize the group operation table interactively.
## Features

- Select prime field Zp from a list of small primes
- Set curve parameters `a` and `b`
- View the group operation table for the selected elliptic curve

## Getting Started
